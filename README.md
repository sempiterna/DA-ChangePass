DA-ChangePass
=============

A small PHP commandline script to change passwords for DA users, or e-mail addresses, or FTP accounts. This script can reset either all accounts, or a single domain, or a single (DA/e-mail/ftp) user.

This script will attempt to download the following required file if it is not found in the same directory. But you can manually download it as well:

http://files.directadmin.com/services/all/httpsocket/httpsocket.php

If `$usesmtp` is set to `Y`, the [PHPmailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) package is required.

Make sure all options are checked and, where needed, updated. All options have a short explanation behind it that explains its function. If you enable the `$sendemailtouser` option, then also check and update the 3 `$mailbody` and `$mailsubject` combinations. Once done, set `$scriptedited` to `Y`.

This script can be executed locally on a DirectAdmin server, but can also connect to (any) DirectAdmin server from a remote location. This is useful if you manage many DirectAdmin servers.

## Usage:

##### Change the password of one user:
`./da_changepass.php --user <username> [optional password]`

If no password is given, a random one will be generated

##### Change the passwords for all users except the admin user:
`./da_changepass.php --alluser`

##### Change the e-mail password for all e-mail accounts on the server:
`./da_changepass.php --allmail`

`./da_changepass.php --mail <domainname>`

##### Change the e-mail password for a specific e-mail address:
`./da_changepass.php --mail <e-mail address> [optional password]`

If no password is given, a random one will be generated

##### Change the ftp account password for all ftp accounts on the server:
`./da_changepass.php --allftp`

##### Change all ftp account passwords for a specific domain:
`./da_changepass.php --ftp <domainname>`

##### Change the ftp account password for a specific account:
`./da_changepass.php --ftp <ftpuser@domain> [optional password]`
